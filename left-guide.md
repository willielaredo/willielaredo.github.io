title: Left Guide
---

Left Guide started as a project whose goal was to measure the strength of the Left in the USA. It was conceived in 2014 before the Bernie campaign, AOC, etc. when the Left had no seats in the US Congress so I couldn't use that as a metric.

I decided to use the Twitter API to measure how people and organizations were gaining or losing strength over time. This led to the Marx and Lenin 500 "M&L 500" concept, which took the idea of the S&P 500, where the capitalist economy is measured and apply the index concept to the Left: find the top 500 organizations and how they are performing over time. Aggregate them all up and you get a sense of the strength of the Left overall. 

The index never took off but I did create profile pages for many twitter accounts that displayed their change in Twitter followers over time. 

The homepage showed a ranked list based on who grew the most in the past day and in the past 7 days. 

You could also select 3 different accounts and compare them.

I then simplified everything and created [Left Links](/left-links) which doesn't involve the twitter data and is a straightforward directory of organizations, categorized and tagged.
