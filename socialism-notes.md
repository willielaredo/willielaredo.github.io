## What socialism means to me

To help answer this for myself, I created a writing project that [you can find here](/socialism). 

Publishing it to the world wide web forces me to be more careful and clear than I would be if I were writing only for myself.

This site aligns with the digital garden concept as explained by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):
> Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis. A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.


## Socialist CV

I joined DSA in 2014 when I first moved to Rhode Island from Brooklyn. I help start the Providence DSA chapter in 2014 and coordinated the local Jacobin reading group. 

In 2015 and 2017 I attended DSA national conventions as an at-large delegate.

In 2016, I helped start up the DSA National Tech Committee, working on committee organization and website migration from Nation Builder to Wordpress.

Upon moving to Northampton in Western Massachusetts, I served on the executive committee of the River Valley DSA Chapter as Treasurer in 2018 and 2020. 

I helped scan back issues of [[Democratic Left]] and [[New American Movement]] publications to create the digital archive that you can find on the [DL website](https://democraticleft.dsausa.org/issues/page/18/).

During COVID time, I took a big step back from DSA to explore other interests and to move to Providence, RI. I have attended a few Rhode Island DSA meetings, but very few and far between.
