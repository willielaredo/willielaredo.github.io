In spring/summer 2022 I took sailing lessons at the [Community Boating Center](https://www.communityboating.com/) in Providence, RI.

In 2022, I sailed quite a bit, but less so in the 2023 season.

In 2024, I could use this space for a sailing journal/log.

There are two boats I've taken out: the RS Quest and the RS Zest.
